    documentation.


    # Definitions Overview


    Insolar is being developed to provide interoperation between enterprises.


    From a business perspective:

      * Any enterprise is regarded as an *entity* with a corresponding *identity* — a **member** object stored in the blockchain.
      * Any member has its own *account* to/from which the member can transfer funds.

    From a technical perspective:

      * Every member object is identified by a **reference** in the blockchain.
      * The reference is effectively the member's *address*.

    Therefore, an entity wishing to transfer funds to/from its account from/to a
    particular address, in Insolar's terms, is a member object identified by its
    reference wishing to transfer funds to some other member identified by the
    corresponding reference.


    Insolar uses these terms in method and parameter names.


    # Request Specification


    Insolar has two types of requests that have the same *base* structure in
    accordance with the [JSON RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
    specification:


    * [Information](#tag/Information) requests that do not require a seed.

    * Contract requests that do. These requests are described in
    [Member](#tag/Member) and [Migration](#tag/Migration) sections.


    Seed is a unique piece of information generated by a node that:


    * has a short lifespan — 10 minutes;

    * expires upon first use;

    * protects from request duplicates.


    Since the seed is generated by a node, it must be validated by the same
    node. Therefore, each subsequent contract request containing the seed must
    be sent to the node that generated it.


    To call a smart contract's method, go through the following steps:


    1. Send a [getSeed](/#operation/get-seed) information request and receive
    the seed.

       For example, the `getSeed` request is as follows:

       ```json
       {
           "jsonrpc": "2.0",
           "id": 1,
           "method": "node.getSeed"
       }
       ```

       And the response is:

       ```json
       {
         "jsonrpc": "2.0",
         "id": 1,
         "result": {
         "seed": "<seed>"
         }
       }
       ```

    2. Form and sign a contract request (e.g.,
    [member.create](/#operation/member-create)) with the acquired seed.

       Every contract request is to contain the Digest and Signature HTTP headers. For example:

       ```
       POST /<endpoint> HTTP/1.1
       Host: <Host>
       Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2019 20:51:35 GMT
       Content-Type: application/json
       Digest: SHA-256=<hashString>
       Signature: keyId="public-key", algorithm="ecdsa", headers="digest", signature=<signatureString>

       { <payload> }
       ```

       And the contract request's `<payload>` with the seed may be as follows:

       ```json
       {
         "jsonprc": "2.0",
         "id": 2,
         "method": "contract.call",
         "params": {
           "seed": "<seed>",
           "callSite": "member.create",
           "callParams": {},
           "publicKey": "<pubicKey>"
         }
       }
       ```

       In this example:

       * [Digest HTTP header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3230#section-4.3.2) contains the Base64 `<hashString>` with the SHA-256 hash of the payload's bytes.

       * [Signature HTTP header](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-cavage-http-signatures-11.html#sig-header) contains the Base64 `<signatureString>` with the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signature in the [ASN.1 DER format](https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-X.690-201508-I!!PDF-E&type=items). Signed are the bytes of the hash from the Digest header.

       * `<pubicKey>` contains a Base64 string with the ECDSA public key in [PEM format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421).

       * `<seed>` contains the seed acquired in the previous `getSeed` request.

       * `"method": "contract.call"` designates a call to a contract's method.

       * `callSite` is the contract method's call point, in this case, `member.create`.

       * `callParams` are the contract method's parameters.

    3. Send the formed and signed contract request to the node that generated
    the seed.

       Insolar responds to contract requests with:

       ```json
       {
         "jsonrpc": "2.0",
         "id": 2,
         "result": {
         "callResult": {
            "reference": <referenceString>
            },
         "requestReference": <requestReferenceString>,
         "traceID": <traceIDString>
         }
       }
       ```
       Where `"callResult"` contains the result of the contract's method execution. In this case, it is a reference to a newly created member object since the `"callSite"` of the request is `"member.create"`.

    # Errors


    Insolar follows the JSON RPC API conventions on [error
    codes](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object), with values
    `-31000`-`-31999` reserved for the Insolar network.


    Below is the list of Insolar Platform errors.

    # Versioning


    API sometimes changes in particular Insolar releases, so it is versioned via
    [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


    API versions do not have correlations to Insolar Platform versions.

        format](https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-X.690-201508-I!!PDF-E&type=items);

        * generated by an ECDSA private key;

        * checked by the paired public key (`publicKey`).
      example: >-
        keyId="member-pub-key", algorithm="ecdsa", headers="digest",
        signature=<signatureString>
      required: true
      schema:
